# PostgreSQL Learning Project

This project is a backend API built with **Express**, **PostgreSQL**, **TypeScript**, and **Node.js**. It is designed as a learning tool to explore and document my progress with PostgreSQL.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to:
- Learn how to connect a Node.js application to a PostgreSQL database.
- Practice writing SQL queries and interacting with a database.
- Document my progress and experiments with PostgreSQL.

## Technologies Used
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building the backend.
- **Express**: Web framework for creating APIs.
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database management system.
- **TypeScript**: Strongly typed programming language for JavaScript.
- **dotenv**: For managing environment variables.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>

2. Install dependencies:
   npm install

3. Create a .env file in the root directory and add your PostgreSQL credentials:
   DB_USER=your_username
   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_NAME=your_database
   DB_PASSWORD=your_password
   DB_PORT=5432

Running the Project
1. Start the server in development mode:
    npm run dev

2. This will use nodemon and ts-node to run the project directly without compiling.

Access the API at http://localhost:3000.


Progress Documentation
I will be documenting my progress with PostgreSQL in this project, including:

1. Writing SQL queries.
2. Managing database schemas.
3. Performing CRUD operations.
